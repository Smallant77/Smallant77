**IT hasn't been long time since I started studying computer science**

```python
def introduceMe():
  print('Sex : {0}, Country : {1}'.format('XY', 'Korean'))
  print('Collage Student since 2019')
  
  major = ['Biology']
  major.append('Want to study Bioinformatics')
  language = ['Python']
  
  print('Major : %s' %major)
  print('Language : %s' %language)
```
